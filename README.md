~ Fork this project to your profile .

~  Create branch with your github username, ex: `add-name.js`.
        NOTE:- **Never use the `master` branch to create PULL REQUEST**.

~  After creating branch you have to create  a file with whatever name you want to
   but as a new creator i suggest  you to create it with your "username.js" on the branch you
   have created dont use master branch for any changes.
   NOTE:- You can use any file extension.

~  Now you have to write a code i will suggest to create a simple program which you like so i can 
   also merge it to the repository.

~  Create Pull-Request to `master` branch in this repository.
